# What do you understand By Database ?

 - A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
  A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).

# What is Normalization ? 

- Normalization is the process to eliminate data redundancy and enhance data integrity in the table.Normalization also helps to organize the data in the database.
  It is a multi-step process that sets the data into tabular form and removes the duplicated data from the relational tables.


# What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?


- DBMS stands for Database Management System, and RDBMS is the acronym for the Relational Database Management system. In DBMS, the data is stored as a file, whereas in RDBMS, 
  data is stored in the form of tables.To know what is the difference between RDBMS and DBMS, check out the table below.

# What is MF Cod Rule of RDBMS Systems?

- Codd's rule in DBMS also known as Codd's 12 rules/commandments is a set of thirteen rules (numbered 0 to 12) that define a database to be a 
  correct Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). If a database follows Codd's 12 rules, it is called a True relational database management system.

#  What do you understand By Data Redundancy? 

 - Data redundancy refers to the practice of keeping data in two or more places within a database or data storage system. 
   Data redundancy ensures an organization can provide continued operations or services in the event something happens to its data -- for example, 
   in the case of data corruption or data loss.

#  What is DDL Interpreter?

 - DDL Interpreter DDL expands to Data Definition Language. DDL Interpreter as the name suggests interprets the DDL statements such as schema definition 
   statements like create, delete, etc.The result of this interpretation is a set of a table that contains the meta-data which is stored in the data dictionary.

#  What is DML Compiler in SQL? 

- DML Compiler DML expands to Data Manipulation Language in DBMS. DML Compiler again as the name suggests compiles(or translates) the DML statements 
  such as select, update and delete statements into low-level instructions which is nothing but the machine-readable object code to make it executable.

#  What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints 
 
 -  SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. 
    This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted.
   EXAMPLE-create a table Student1 with three columns Name, Age, and ID. While making the table, you must keep the Name and ID column as NOT NULL.

#  What is save Point? How to create a save Point write a Query? 

- A save point is a logical rollback point within a transaction.
 When you set a save point, whenever an error occurs past a save point, you can undo the events you have done up to the save point using the rollback.

#  What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?
- A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server. 
  DML triggers run when a user tries to modify data through a data manipulation language (DML) event.
  DML events are INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements on a table or view.
